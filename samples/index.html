			<h1>Recent Projects, Sites, and Snippets</h1>

			<p>I'd like to share some of my recent projects and some code/markup snippets, so you can get to better know my work, and the output of my work.</p>
			
			<h3>Halifax Scooter Council (In Development)</h3>
			<p>The Halifax Scooter Council is a group of scooterists who meet to organize events, group rides, and a yearly rally. In previous years, the organization was smaller and events were planned by word-of-mouth. As the group grew larger, a centralized place for meets was needed, and the club launched a website and began using Facebook to communicate.</p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, some of the members do not use Facebook, the club "leaders" are not extremely adept Facebook users, and would prefer a stronger web presence. I joined the club, and decided about one month ago to undertake redoing the site from a <a href="http://halifaxscootercouncil.com" class="flowerpot">series of static HTML pages</a> that were <a href="images/hsc-con.png" class="flowerpot" title="The Members section on the old site was never created, but the new site has all members stored in a database.">rarely updated</a> to a dynamic Rails site that allows users to upload their photo and pictures of their scooters, post events/group rides, and send to friends to promote the Rally. The site is undergoing some minor tweaks and design touches while the domain transfers over to me; I plan to launch the new site on July 18.</p>
			
			<p>Because the site is not yet live, I've included a sample of its <a href="http://gist.github.com/470094">HTML</a> and <a href="http://gist.github.com/470096">CSS</a>.</p>

			<h4>Technologies Used/Implemented:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Apache 2, MySQL, lighttpd, Ruby on Rails 3</li>
				<li>RESTful API with RESTful user authentication</li>
				<li>self-service for users and admins (edit pages, events, etc.)</li>
				<li>file uploads and processing with ImageMagick</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Prey Fetcher</h3>
			
			<p>I'm a pretty avid Twitter user &mdash; something like a bad habit. I've found the service useful, but I lamented that there was no way for me to get notified of mentions when I was away from my computer without running a service on my computer. I didn't like that solution; sometimes my machine is off, and figured others with laptops were in the same boat.</p>
			
			<p>To solve the problem, and to get my feet wet with Ruby on Rails, I created <a href="http://preyfetcher.com" class="flowerpot">Prey Fetcher</a>, a free service that pushes mentions to your iPhone (or iPod Touch/iPad) instantly. It also watches Twitter lists and direct messages and polls the REST API to deliver those notifications in a timely manner. The user interface is simple; just sign-in with your Twitter account using their OAuth system and an account is created in the Prey Fetcher system.</p>
			
			<p>In May of this year, I <a href="http://github.com/tofumatt/Prey-Fetcher" class="flowerpot">open-sourced Prey Fetcher</a>, so that others could benefit from its code and hopefully add features; many of its users seem to be of a technical nature, based on discussions I've had with them.</p>
			
			<h4>Technologies Used/Implemented:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Apache 2, PostgreSQL (later MySQL), lighttpd, Ruby on Rails 2.3</li>
				<li>OAuth authentication</li>
				<li>Streaming API daemon built with Ruby EventMachine</li>
				<li>1,000 of users with tonnes of room to scale on a $5/month VPS</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>FristPost (In Development)</h3>
			
			<p>I've been interested in starting to publish articles online, but was not content with the popular blogging software that existed; WordPress and Drupal were too clunky to me, and I especially didn't like their code (this mattered, as I'd be writing about software development).</p>
			
			<p>In the time-honoured tradition, I set out to write the best piece of blogging software ever &mdash; not really, but I started working on a CodeIgniter app called FristPost that had a more flexible license (BSD) and would be easy for developers to build on without having every feature ever. It was my first CodeIgniter app, and is currently under development.</p>
			
			<p><a href="http://github.com/tofumatt/FristPost" class="flowerpot">FristPost is an open-source app</a>.</p>
			
			<h4>Technologies Used/Implemented:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Database-agnostic, thanks to CodeIgniter's ActiveRecord</li>
				<li>Simple key/value cache store system that has multiple drivers (Filesystem, Database, Memcache, and "null" &mdash; for development)</li>
				<li>MVC with thin views thanks to Smarty templates</li>
				<li>Emphasis on performance; over twice as fast as WordPress, even in development mode</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Nova Scotia Government and Nova Scotia <em>Come to life</em></h3>
			
			<p>I've worked heavily with the <a href="http://gov.ns.ca" class="flowerpot">provincial Government</a>, including the <a href="http://novascotialife.com" class="flowerpot"><em>Come to life</em></a> initiative, to improve the accessibility, best practices, markup, and progressiveness of their sites and web applications. Much of the output of this work involves dealing with vendors and providing them with a web standards guide that I was a part in creating, and building an ASP framework that web developers of varying skill across government can use to easily create websites sharing a common look-and-feel.</p>
			
			<p>I have moved numerous services and sites from propriety software to free and open-source software to save money, improve quality, and lower barrier-to-entry for external vendors. This includes moving the <em>Come to life</em> site to the <a href="http://drupal.org" class="flowerpot">Drupal CMS</a> and developing new internal web apps to use databases and PHP/Rails instead of email/ASP. The main government site still runs on Windows, though I have suggested a reverse-HTTP proxy server to free developers of the Windows platform. This idea has been well-received.</p>
			
			<p>My most recent project in government was to implement best practices in terms of software development, including the use of <a href="http://git-scm.com/" class="flowerpot">git</a> for version control, PHP and Ruby frameworks for web development, status/issue tracking with <a href="http://www.redmine.org/" class="flowerpot">Redmine</a>, and app deployment with <a href="http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html" class="flowerpot">vlad</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Other Code and Markup</h3>
			
			<p>Other projects and smaller libraries I've worked on are <a href="http://github.com/tofumatt/">hosted on GitHub (http://github.com/tofumatt/)</a>. I hope this has given you a good sense about the quality of my work and range of my skills.</p>
			
			<p>Please <a href="mailto:matt@lonelyvegan.com">contact me (matt@lonelyvegan.com)</a> if you would like to see any more samples. Thanks very much for taking the time to look at my work.</p>

			<p>All work, from HTML to design, is the work of me (Matthew Riley MacPherson) with the exception of the following materials on the Halifax Scooter Council site:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>photography in the header</li>
				<li>icons in the footer</li>
				<li>company/sponsor logos</li>
				<li>"Rally in the Valley" poster</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The circular "mod" logo is a common design in scooter materials;<br />the "HSC mod logo" is my take on it, and is an original work.</p>
