    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>I'm a web developer from Montreal, Canada.</strong> I love <a href="https://foursquare.com/tofumatt/list/bangkok" title="Actually, most of these places aren't Thai. Street food doesn't have Foursquare entries!">Thai food</a>, <a href="http://lonelyvegan.com/background.jpg">vintage motorcycles</a>, and <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/people/tofumatt/">world travel</a>. I <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt">make web apps at Mozilla</a>, the company behind the lovely <a href="https://mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox web browser</a>. I like to hack on other things, from computers to cocktails. I'm a total motorcycle junkie and <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com">I sometimes find graphic designers cute</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>My projects</h2>

    <p>
      I'm interested in making people's life better through technology, mostly because I don't have the patience for politics. I've worked on a lot of stuff over the years, but these are my pet projects:
    </p>

    <h4>Firefox OS, Web</h4>
    <h3>Discover what's <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt/around">around</a></h3>

    <p>
      Foursquare is pretty awesome. It's chock-full of useful information for locals and foreigners alike, but there wasn't a solid web experience on mobile or the desktop. So I made one.
    </p>

    <p>
      around is an offline-capable, fully-HTML5 web app that uses Foursquare and Open Street Maps to let you <strong>explore your surroundings</strong> in any modern web browser or on any mobile phone. It's <em>currently in development</em> but should be released by the end of 2013.
    </p>

    <h4>iOS, Firefox OS, Web</h4>
    <h3>Understand the <a href="http://facevalueapp.com">Face Value</a></h3>

    <p>
      I travel <em>a lot</em>. What many people from Canada and the USA don't realise is that in many parts of the world: cash is king. Frustrated with my lack of knowledge of foreign currencies' worth and ugly currency conversion apps, I created <a href="http://facevalueapp.com">Face Value</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's <strong>currency conversion using real denominations</strong>, so you can understand the strange pieces of paper in your pocket while you're bartering in Bangkok or surfing in Lisbon.
