This is my homepage â€” it's about me and stuff. It's all static files that gets served quite fast by [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/). I don't need to make it private (because it's all public stuff anyway), and because I'm on the GitHub micro plan. I guess I should license the site and its content though, eh?
