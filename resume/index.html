			<h1>Matthew Riley MacPherson's Résumé</h1>
			
			<p>I'm a software developer and design enthusiast who has been writing awesome web applications for the past four years in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. I'm an autodidact who's able to learn quickly but a great mentor who's able to teach effectively.</p>
			
			<p>I work on my own open source projects and want the web to remain the open, powerful platform for communication, education, and information it is today.</p>
			
			<p>Although I've attended university, I am, as previously mentioned, someone who is very self-taught (from programming to motorcycling). I think my constant interest in learning more about development, design, and standards, along with my work experience, paint a better picture of me than my time spent in school.</p>
			
			<h2>Education</h2>
			
			<dl>
				<dt><a href="http://www.smu.ca/">Saint Mary's University</a><br> 2007-2009</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I attended some computer science courses, part-time, at Saint Mary's to build on my knowledge of computer science and programming.</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><a href="http://www.cbu.ca/">Cape Breton University</a><br> 2006-2007</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I worked on completing a B.A. with a major in Economics, completing nearly two years worth of work in a single year thanks to obtaining three full-course credits in high school. I remain highly interested in economics (particularly macroeconomics and game theory), though I was unable to find the time to complete my degree after I began working full-time as a web developer.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<h2>Work Experience</h2>
			
			<dl>
				<dt><a href="http://viewpoint.ca/">ViewPoint.ca</a><br> 2010-Present</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I'm currently working on a unique realty web app for Nova Scotian real estate buyers, sellers, and realtors. We merge property data/lines, MLS® listings, and more onto a Google Maps interface that anyone can access for free.</p>
					
					<p>I'm chiefly involved with the visual design, front-end development (including our HTTP API), performance, and user experience of the site. I've greatly increased site accessibility to people with disabilities while increasing our use of emerging web standards like HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
					
					<p>When there's quiet time, I work on a new, rewritten version of ViewPoint's iPhone app.</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><a href="http://gov.ns.ca">Nova Scotia Government</a> / <a href="http://novascotialife.com">Nova Scotia <em>Come to life</em></a><br> 2007-2010</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I worked on the team responsible for government-wide initiatives on accessibility, code standards, developer support, open government, social media use, and web development.</p>
					
					<p>I introduced many government communicators and developers to Facebook and Twitter, wrote public &amp; internal web apps, and helped standardize design across government sites.</p>
					
					<p>I put a focus on breaking down barriers to access government web services and improved the accessibility (and quality) of many essential services offered to hundreds of thousands of Nova Scotians online.</p>
					
					<p>I also pushed for greater involvement and use of open source. I migrated numerous web apps/sites from Flash, Java, and proprietary Microsoft technologies to free &amp; open source software using W3C-vetted web standards.</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><a href="https://github.com/tofumatt">Open Source</a><br> 2007-Present</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I'm constantly trying to increase my involvement with open source projects. I have written a fair number of open source apps/libraries, which I <a href="https://github.com/tofumatt">release on GitHub</a>.</p>
					
					<p>My biggest project is <a href="http://preyfetcher.com">Prey Fetcher</a>, an open source Twitter notification service for iOS. The service is free and has thousands of users, having been online for nearly two years.</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Freelance Web Development<br> 2006-Present</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Occasionally I do web development and consulting for small businesses in Nova Scotia. I've built sites from the ground-up using existing CMS/hosted systems (Drupal, Tumblr, WordPress) and custom-built (PHP, Python, Ruby) apps.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<h2>Skills</h2>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Accessibility, Design, and User Experience</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I build highly accessible websites that offer equivalent experiences for users with disabilities, on mobile devices, and with low-bandwidth/JavaScript-disabled web browsers.</p>
					
					<p>I put emphasis on visual design, user experience, and simplicity of software and sites. I build things I would want to use; I want to make them accessible, beautiful, and easy (hey, sometimes I browse the web in Lynx too).</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Programming Languages</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I'm proficient in object-oriented programming and a fan of writing clear, commented, concise, maintainable, and well-structured code.</p>
					
					<p>Languages I use every day:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
						<li>PHP</li>
						<li>Python</li>
						<li>Ruby</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>I'm also quite comfortable with:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>C</li>
						<li>Objective-C</li>
						<li>Perl</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>I explore other programming languages frequently, but those are the ones I'm most familiar with.</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Frameworks and Tools</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Databases:</strong> MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite</li>
						<li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Cocoa, Django, jQuery, Kohana, MooTools, Rails</li>
						<li><strong>Mail Serving:</strong> Courier, Dovecot, postfix</li>
						<li><strong>SCM Tools:</strong> git, mercurial, svn</li>
						<li><strong>Software:</strong> bash/zsh, general UNIX geekery, Mac OS X, Photoshop, Xcode</li>
						<li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Apache, lighttpd, Phusion Passenger, nginx</li>
						<li><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> CSS3, HTML(5), FGCI, GIS, Google Maps API, Memcached, OAuth, Twitter APIs, WSGI</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Technical Writing</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>I'm able to write approachable, technical documentation for developers of various familiarly and skill levels (with regards to the code/software in question). I wrote concise, informative documentation for web developers in government allowing web developers with varying experience levels to create full-fledged government sites on their own.</p>
				</dd>

			<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
			
			<p>I'm a coffee, craft beer, and food nut. I'm also a bit of an automobile enthusiast. On the (somewhat rare) occasion I'm not building something cool on my computer, I'm probably cooking or driving my motorcycle. I also have a <a href="http://lonelyvegan.com/mini-cooper">MINI Cooper</a> that, on the really cold or rainy days, I'm known to drive around town.</p>
			
			<p>I'm interested in public speaking and writing and want to get more involved with both of those things. I'm also involved with the <a href="http://halifaxscootercouncil.com/rally-in-the-valley">Halifax Scooter Council's annual Rally in the Valley</a> and fundraising efforts.</p>
			
			<h2>Contact</h2>
			
			<p>The best way to get in touch with me is via email: <a href="hello@lonelyvegan.com">hello@lonelyvegan.com</a>. If you want to have a chat on the phone, send me an email and we'll hook something up.</p>
